Peer to Peer Architecture

Contrary to the client server model where the server acts as the center that
deals with all the requests. In peer to peer network there is a decentralized
model where each node acts as a peer. There is no dedicated server and each
peer can act as both a server and a client.

In this form of a network each peer can make request to other peers and at
the same time can respond to request from other peers. The performance of
such a network increases as the number of peers join the network.
These peers can then collaborate and share bandwidth with each other
to complete the task at hand. Various peer to peer networks for file sharing
have come into existence since the demise of Napster e.g. KaZaA, WinMX and BitTorrent etc.

In peer to peer networks the data is still transferred through the physical layer
but it is at the application layer where peers are able to communicate with each other directly.


Advantages of a Peer to Peer Network 

The cost related with a peer to peer network is relatively low compared
to a client-server network. In a client server network an expensive powerful
server needs to be purchased, whereas in the case of peer to peer network a
userâ€™s machine acts as a both a server and a client and therefore no additional
cost such as technical cost of maintaining the server is not there. 

Additionally, peer to networks are more fault tolerant. In client-server model if the server
fails no communication can take place and neither can transfer of resources.
Whereas in a peer to peer network if one peer fails another peer can be used as a server.
Additionally, if the number of clients increase the load on the server increases,
on the contrary if the number of peers increase in a P2P network the bandwidth
is shared among various peers. This can be seen in the case of a BitTorrent
file sharing. The larger the number of peers the faster it is to download
a file as the same file can be downloaded from various peers.


Disadvantages

P2P network though associated with various advantages comes with various drawbacks also.
One of the major disadvantage of a peer to peer network is the security threats
which are associated with it. Distribution of virus, TCP port issues and downloading of
illegal content are some issues.

The cost related with peer to peer networks are so low then why are not big companies
using this instead of client-server model? There is a reason for that,
files and folders cannot be centrally backed up. Since the content is distributed
among various machines in a P2P network, backups cannot be created
and files cannot be indexed. Since files are distributed over various
systems it might be difficult to find a resource on the network. These
are few reasons why P2P network is not the industry standard.
