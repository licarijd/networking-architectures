Domain Name System


DNS is a means for a device to translate a naming system into its assiciated IP Adress.

It's used to resolve domain names to the webserver IP Address it is trying to communicate with.

DNS uses TCP or UDP (normally UDP).

It uses port 53.

In the case of load balancing, the IP address for a domain might change (since there are multiple servers).


How DNS Works:

Every device on a network requries an IP address to communicate across a network.

Your computer will take the domain name, and forward it to the DNS server.

The DNS server compares the address its associated to, and forwards the packet to that address.


Example

Computer 1 wants to send data to a webserver.

It forwards it's segment (with source and destination port numbers) to the webserver's port
53 (DNS). The DNS then sends the IP address of the webserver back to computer 1
(so source and destination IP addresses flip). Computer 1 builds a packet (TCP connection), with 
IP address information (TCP). The source port changes to computer 1s source port, 
and the destination port becomes 80 (the port for HTTP). It sends to the webserver,
and the webserver responds with an HTTP connection.
