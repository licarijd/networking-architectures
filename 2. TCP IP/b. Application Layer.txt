The Application Layer - Layer 5

- Provides an interface between applications on different computers.

- Usually, one application is a web browser, and the other is a web server,
like IIS or Apache.

- Application Layer is considered to be for our communication protocols.


Protocols:

- BGP

- HTTP

- DNS

- FTP

- TFTP

- TELNET

- SSH

- LDAP

- SMTP

Others: POP3, NTP, RTP, SNMP, IMAP, SIP, RIP, STSP, XMPP


Example

Browsers resolve a host IP address using DNS. A domain name resolves to an IP address.

Once the IP address information is sent back, a connection needs to be established with the
webserver so that resources such as HTML and images can be retrieved over the network.
The HTTP Protocol is used to establish the connection.

POP3 and IMAP are used for email communication.

To remotely administer a device, Telnet or SSH can be used.
