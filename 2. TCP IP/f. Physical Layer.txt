Physical Layer


The Physical Layer deals with standards from organizations that deal with the physical
characteristics for transmitting data. the Physical Layer sends bits of data (binary data).

Examples

- NIC (Network Interface Cards)

- Ethernet

- Hub (a device which forwards data)

- repeater


When a network device (Layer 1) receives the bits of data (binary data), 
it will go up to Layer 2 to get physical addressing (MAC addressing) information
for source and destination.

Then it will go to Layer 3 to get virtual addressing (IP addressing) information
for source and destination.

Then it will go to Layer 4 to get port information
for source and destination.

Lastly, it will go to Layer 5 to determine which application will be needed.


Benefits of the OSI Model, and networking models in general:

- Less complex than not using a layered model

- Network models breaks the concepts into smaller, logically distinct parts

- They provide standard interfaces

- The standard interface definitions between each layer allow multiple vendors to create products
that fill a particular role, with the benefits of open competition

- Easier program changes and faster product development due to reduced complexity

- Creating products to meet the same networking standards means that computers and 
networking gear from multiple vendors can work in the same network

- Modular engineering

- One vendor can write software that implements higher layers (eg, a web browser),
while another vendor can write software that implements lower layers
(eg. Microsoft's built in TCP/IP software in Windows)
