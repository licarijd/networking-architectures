Data Encapsulation at Various Layers


Layer 4

- Has Segments

- Segments have a header with port information, and data (HTTP data block)

- Routers are Layer 4 devices


Layer 3

- Has Packets

- Packets have a header with IP (logical) address information, and data (including data from Layer 4)

- Switches are Layer 3 devices


Layer 2

- Has Frames

- Frames have a header with Mac (Physical) address information, data (including data from Layer 3),
 and a trailer with FCS information

- FCS (Frame Check Sequence) is a 4 byte field used to verify that there were no transmission issues


** In every step of the Data Encapsulation process, the source and destination will need to be flipped.
For example, a web server receiving data will have to change the source to itself, and the destination to 
the sender.
