Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)


HTTP is a protocol which is used to transfer information between web clients and web servers
(Layer 7)

HTTP uses port 80.

HTTPS uses port 443.

Both HTTP and HTTPS use the TCP protocol to connect to servers.

Invlolves a 3-way handshake.


Example

Client (browser) types in a domain name (a packet is constructed and sent to the DNS).

The DNS responds with an IP address.

The client builds a TCP connection, and requests an HTTP connection from the server (SYN).

The server responds with a SYN-ACK to acknowledge the connection.

Finally, the client responds with an ACK to acknowledge the HTTP connection.
