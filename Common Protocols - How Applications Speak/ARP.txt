Address Resolution Protocol


ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses, and stores the information in an ARP Table

Computers and routers have ARP Tables. The devices will look at their ARP Table when they 
need to send information across the networks, so it can learn the Layer 3 addressing (logical)
and Layer 2 addressing (physical) assiciated to it.

ARP Broadcasts are used to find devices on a network that are not listed in the ARP Table.
The broadcasts go out to every Computer except the one sending the request.
The Broadcast Address is always FFFF.FFFF.FFFF.

Routers (Layer 3 devices) are the only devices on networks that seprate broadcast domains.
Routers use IP addresses to communicate packets across networks.
