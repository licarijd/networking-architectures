The OSI Model


Open Systems Interconnection

- older Model

- 7 layers


Layer 7 - Application Layer

Layer 6 - Presentation Layer

Layer 5 - Session Layer

Layer 4 - Transport Layer

Layer 3 - Network Layer

Layer 2 - Data-Link Layer

Layer 1 - Physical Layer


These layers are the same as the TCP / IP Model, which the exeption of some top layer.

Layers 1, 2, 3, 4 are roughly the same. Layer 5-7 of the OSI Model make up Layer 5 
(The Application Layer) of the TCP IP Model.


Layer 7 - The Application Layer

- Provides an interface between the communication software and applications that need to 
communicate

Layer 6 - The Presentation Layer

- Defines and negotiates data formats, such ASCII,
EBCDIC, binary, JPEG, etc

- Encryption is also a presentation service

Layer 5 - The Session Layer

- Defines how to start, control, and end sessions.

- Includes control management of messages, so that the applications can be notified if only some
part of a series of messages are completed

- This allows the Presentation Layer seamless view of the data system
