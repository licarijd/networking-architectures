Data Link Layer


The Data Link Layer defines rules that determine when a device can send data over a particular medium

The Data Link Layer defines the format of a header and trailer that allows devices attached to 
the medium to successfully send and receive data.


Protocols


Ethernet

- Physical Addressing (MAC Addressing)

MAC addresses are made up of 48 bits of characters (12 characters). 

The first 24 are the OUI (Organizational Unique Identifier), eg. Dell's brand. They are hexadecimal digits.

The next 24 are assigned by the vendor (randomized).


ARP - Address Resolution Protocol

- Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses

Example - 3 computers are connected to a local area netowork.

** Note - A LAN switch is a network device that cross connects clients, servers, and network devices.
They're also known as frame switches, and are common in Ethernet networks.

Switches only concern themselves with MAC Adresses.

If Computer 1 is trying to communicate with Computer 3, and the ARP table on Computer 1 is empty 
(no recognition of any APR IP addresses), it sends an ARP broadcast (a bunch of Fs inside of the MAC
address for the destination). This broadcast goes through the switch, to Computers 2 and 3.

Computer 2 says nope, not for me.

Computer 3 says it's for me.

So Computer 3 sends it back, along with it's MAC address. Computer 1 adds it to it's ARP table.


PPP - Point to Point connections


WAP - Wireless Point to Point connections (WiFi)


Switches are Layer 2 Devices


Remember, IP Addresses are just made up numbers. They are logical addresses.

Network Interface Cards are physical, and provide MAC addresses.


Frames

- Encapsulate all data above it

Header

- Source / dest MAC address information is put into a header,
to determine where it's going to on a LAN network


Trailer 

- FCS (Frame Check Sequence) - 4 byte field used to verify that there were no transmission issues
