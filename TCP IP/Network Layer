Network Layer


The Network Layer defines ways for our data to communicate to devices across networks.


It does this by using Logical Addressing

- Logical Addressing is routed

- Logical Addressing defines how each device can have an address (IP Address)
that can be used by the routing process

Example

Every device needs another computer's IP address and subnet mask to connect with it.
A subnet mask is used to divide an IP address into two parts; one identifies the host computer,
and the othe rpart identifies the network to which it belongs. The process of defining how logical 
(IP) addresses are assigned is done by logical addressing.

- A Default Gateway is needed to communicate across networks. A router's Default Gateway is it's 
gateway to the internet


Forwarding (Routing)

- Defines how devices (Routers or Layer 3 Switches) forward packets to their final destination

- Refers to the work done by routing protocols to learn all possible routes and choose the best one


Example

When a packet comes in to a router, the router takes the IP information, looks at it's routing table,
and compares the information it has to the routing table to determine where it is going.
It then determines the best path to take (best destination in the network to forward the packet to).

A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.
They are usually connected to two or more different networks. When a data packet comes
to a router port, the router reads address info in the packet to determine which port to send the 
packet to. Routers use routing tables to determine which interface the packet will be sent. A routing
table lists all networks for which routes are known. A routing table contains all necessary info
to forward a packet to the best path towards it's destination, and provides the router with instructions
for sending the packet to the next hop on it's route accross the network.
Routers dynamically update their routing tables.

Each entry in a routing table consists of a:

Network ID - the network ID or destination corresponding to the route 

Subnet Mask - the mask that is used to match a destination IP address to the to the Network ID 

Next Hop - the IP address to which the packet is forwarded

Outgoing Interface - the interface that the packet should go to, in order to reach the destination network 

Metric - a common use of the metric is to indicate the minimum number of hops (routers crossed)
to the network ID


Protocols


Routed Protocols 

- Uses IP protocol

- Needs an addressing scheme

- IP (IPv4, IPv6) which is used for addressing

- ICMP

ICMP is used for ping, which we use to test direct network connectivity. So, many network monitoring
tools will use ICMP, eg. monitoring speeds, diagnostics, etc.


Routing Protocols 

- Protocols between routers 

- Routing Protocols determine which path is the best to take

- Build routing tables

3 types - Distance Vector, Link State, Hybrid


IPSec - IP security

IGMP


Devices that operate at this level are routers, or Layer 3 switches


Packet

- When we talk about data moving through the network, we say "packet" or "frame".

- At Layer 4, we have segments.

- At Layer 3, we have packets, which is the Layer 3 data encapsulation header.
It encapsulates all data above it into a data header, and uses source and IP address information
to know where it's going.

Example

From HTTP, we have data in a data block with source/dest port info in the segment header.
That entire data block is encapsulated into a new data block, with a new header added to it.
The new header has source/dest IP information. So, when we're communicating this data thorugh the network, and it 
gets to the routers, the router looks at the destination and compares it to the routing table.
And, it knows the best path for the information.



- At Layer 2, we have frames.
