TCP - Transport Control Protocol

IP - Internet Protocol


The TCP/IP Architecture is made up of many protcols at each of the layers.

Uses these protocols to establish connections and transmit our data across the network.


Original

Layer 1 - Link

Layer 2 - Internet

Layer 3 - Transport

Layer 4 - Application


Updated

Layer 1 - Physical

Layer 2 - Data-Link

Layer 3 - Network

Layer 4 - Transport

Layer 5 - Application


So, the Internet Layer was renamed the Netowork Layer, and the Link Layer was split into the
Physical Layer and the Data Link Layer.


The Physical Layer deals with the physical transmission of actual data bits,
invloving ethernet cables, hardware, network interface cards etc.

The Data-Link Layer deals with the protocols we use to build frames - using MAC Addresses, PPPs,
frame relays etc.
